# Java-Design-Patterns
Design patterns are typical repeatable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.  
A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. 
It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.  

They are classified into three types:
1. [Creational Patterns](#creational-patterns)
2. [Behavioral Patterns](#behavioral-patterns)
3. [Structural Patterns](#structural-patterns)

## Creational Patterns
Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, 
which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

## Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Structural Patterns
Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, 
while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
